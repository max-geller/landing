# Max Geller Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js and TypeScript. It is deployed on Vercel at [maxgeller.com](https://https://portfolio-max-geller.vercel.app/). It is a work in progress, and I am always adding new features and content.

## Features

- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Next.js
- [x] Tailwind CSS
- [x] Vercel
- [x] Typed.JS
- [x] ParticlesJS
- [x] FontAwesome Icons

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

To deploy on vercel, use the Vercel CLI:

    ```
    vercel deploy
    ```
